# Your Code as a Crime Scene: The Tools for Python 3

An updated version of Adam Tornhill's Python scripts used in his book "Your Code as a Crime Scene".
The scripts have been migrated from Python 2 to Python 3, because installing Python 2 on Windows is a bit tricky.

You can have a look at the original scripts at https://adamtornhill.com/code/crimescenetools.htm.
